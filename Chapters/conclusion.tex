This report described Solid-State properties of Calcium. Basic issues describing calcium have been determined like:
\begin{itemize}
\item primitive vectors
\item packaging factor
\item Miller-Indices of the planes
\end{itemize}
and also some more complicated factors:
\begin{itemize}
\item Geometric Structure Factor
\item Reciprocal Lattice
\end{itemize}
To determine which X-ray wavelength should be used to determine a maximum diffraction (spot) there was a need to use Ewald sphere issue. There were also performed some mathematical deductions in order to find density of states. Whole report helps to undarstand basic assumptions of solid state physics.
