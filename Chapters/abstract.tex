\section{ABSTRACT}

The goal of this report is to show the basic concepts of Solid-State Physics in general and especially for Calcium. In Chapter 1 we will talk about Crystal Structure and how it is described, chapter two will provide further informations about how to determine these structures.
To get further insides in the topic of Solid-State Physics Chapter 3, we will discuss some of the models which are used to describe Atoms which are not at rest at their lattice site.
