\section*{ABSTRACT}
The goal of this report is to show the basic concepts of Solid-State Physics in general and especially for Calcium. In Chapter \ref{chap1} we will talk about Crystal Structure and how it is described, the lattice in which Calcium crystalyzed could be identified and basic properties derived
Chapter \ref{chap2} will provide further informations about how to determine these structures. Diffraction patters for Calcium could be derived.
To get further insides in the topic of Solid-State Physics in Chapter \ref{chap3}, we will discuss some of the models which are used to describe Atoms which are not at rest at their lattice site.
