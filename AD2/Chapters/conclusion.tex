This report achieved in \ref{chap1} \nameref{chap1} and \ref{chap2} \nameref{chap2}
basic understanding in these topics, which were further necessary to 
understand and calculate properties of the Cadmium sulfide semiconductor in
\ref{chap3} \nameref{chap3}. This goal was achieved.

In \ref{chap1} \nameref{chap1} for a given monovalent metal which crystals in the FFC structure
with a unit cell size of  $a = 4.09 \mathring{A}$ the the collistion
time could be calculated as:

$$\tau = 28.5 \cdot 10^{-14}s$$

Also an expression for the cycloton frequency could be obtained
$$\omega = \frac{eB}{m^*}$$


The value of the intrinsic fermi level for CdS was found to be
$$E_{Fi} = 1.326 eV$$

as well as the intrinsic carrier concentration is
$$n_i = 0.959 \cdot 10^3 \frac{1}{m^3}$$

The intrinsic resistivity for the semiconductor could be determind 
as:

$$\rho_{intrinsic} = $$

\autoref{fig:CDS-Band} was used to identify Cadmium Sulfide
as a direct Band Gap semiconductor.

The exciton binding energy inside of CdS and also the radius in 
which the exciton orbits could be calculated for the ground state
$n=1$

$$E_{Ex} = 0.0286 eV$$
$$r_n = 28.314 \mathring{A}$$
