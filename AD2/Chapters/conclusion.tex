For a given monovalent metal which crystals in the FFC structure
with a unit cell size of  $a = 4.09 \mathring{A}$ the the collistion
time could be calculated as:

$$\tau = 28.5 \cdot 10^{-14}s$$

Also an expression for the cycloton frequency could be obtained
$$\omega = \frac{eB}{m^*}$$


The value of the intrinsic fermi level for CdS was found to be
$$E_{Fi} = 1.326 eV$$

as well as the intrinsic carrier concentration is
$$n_i = 0.959 \cdot 10^3 \frac{1}{m^3}$$
