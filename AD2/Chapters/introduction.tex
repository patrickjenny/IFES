Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is in the class II-VI semiconductor.

In \ref{chap1} \nameref{chap1} we will use the free elecon model 
to obtain some results for a given metal and discribe some of the
basic concepts. In the model metals are

In \ref{chap2} \nameref{chap2} 
\textit{Elementary Solid State Physics} \cite{elementary_SSP} delivered insights in these concepts to get 

 In \ref{chap3} \nameref{chap3} we will show some of these effects.
