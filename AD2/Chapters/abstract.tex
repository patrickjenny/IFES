\section*{ABSTRACT}
The goal of this report is to present some basic models in Solid State physics and to undarstand how doping in semiconductors works taking as a example cadmium sulfide. In Chapter 2.1 we will consider some issues in free electron model. Chapter 2.2 Starting with electron of Bloch and then investigating electronic band structure. In chapter 2.3 we focus on semiconductors especially made of CdS. How doping effects on semiconductor and what are the outcome of this.An intrinsic option were also considered. The intrinsic fermi level for Cds could be calculated
as $E_{Fi} = 1.326 eV$ as well as the intrinsic carrier concetration with
$n_i = 0.959 \cdot 10^3 \frac{1}{m^3}$. By considering acceptor impurities
$(10^{15}cm^{-3})$ in the 
CdS semiconductor the difference of the fermi level to the intrinsic fermi level 
could also be obained $(E_F-E_{Fi}) = -0.896 eV $ at $T=300\degree K$.
